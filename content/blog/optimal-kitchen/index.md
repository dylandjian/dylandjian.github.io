# Cutting and Chopping Tools

In the realm of culinary arts, cutting and chopping tools serve as the cornerstone of every kitchen. They play a pivotal role in transforming raw ingredients into finely crafted dishes, making the choice of these tools a significant factor in the art of culinary preparation.

## Cutting (Knives, Shears)

The world of cutting tools is a diverse landscape, featuring an array of knives and shears, each tailored for specific tasks. From the choice of materials to the craftsmanship of different countries, understanding the nuances of these tools can elevate your kitchen skills.

### Country

Different countries bring their own expertise to knife craftsmanship.

- ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japanese knives are renowned for precision and sharpness, often featuring a single bevel. Materials include high-carbon steel or VG-10 steel.

- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French knives, such as those from Sabatier, emphasize craftsmanship and versatility, often using high-carbon stainless steel.

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German knives, exemplified by brands like Wusthof or Henckels, are durable and well-balanced, typically using high-carbon stainless steel or X50CrMoV15 steel.

### Materials

The materials used in crafting cutting tools have a profound impact on their performance and maintenance. Here's a glimpse into common materials and their trade-offs

## Boards

A well-crafted cutting board is more than just a surface; it's a partner in your culinary journey, providing stability for chopping and preserving the lifespan of your knives.

### Materials

Choosing the right material for your cutting board is crucial.
In my kitchen, I opted for the Plastic Board Large size for its low maintenance and the added benefit of encouraging regular knife sharpening, a practice essential for any culinary enthusiast. Here's a glimpse into common materials and their considerations.

## Maintenance Tips

Maintaining your cutting and chopping tools is vital for their longevity and optimal performance. Here are some maintenance tips to ensure your tools stay in top condition.

### Knife Sharpening

Regularly sharpening your knives is a fundamental aspect of maintenance. Consider the following methods:

#### Sharpening Stones

Use stones with varying grit levels for a comprehensive sharpening process. Follow the correct angle for your knife (typically around 20 degrees) and use a consistent motion.

- **Coarse Grit (200-800)**: Ideal for repairing damaged blades or reshaping the edge.
- **Medium Grit (800-1500)**: Smoothens out coarse scratches and refines the edge.
- **Fine Grit (1500-3000)**: Provides a polished finish and sharpens to a razor edge.
- **Recommendation**: [Here](https://www.amazon.fr/Homtone-Aiguiseur-couteaux-aiguiser-antid%C3%A9rapante/dp/B08BRYN7KT) is a good set for that.

#### Honing Rods

Choose a honing rod made of a hard material like ceramic or diamond.

- **Ceramic Rods**: Ideal for honing and maintaining an already sharp edge.
- **Diamond Rods**: Effective for more aggressive honing and minor sharpening.
  Hold the knife at a 15-20 degree angle and swipe it along the rod from base to tip.
- **Recommendation**: [Here](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B09WZX2BSQ) is a good recommendation that I am personally using

#### Electric Knife Sharpeners

Convenient for quick sharpening, electric sharpeners provide a guided system for consistent results.
Follow the manufacturer's guidelines and ensure the knife is clean before sharpening.

### Proper Cleaning

#### Knives

Cleanliness is crucial for both hygiene and the lifespan of your cutting tools:

- **Handwash** knives and cutting tools with warm, soapy water immediately after use. Avoid leaving knives in the sink, as they can be damaged or cause accidents.
- **Avoid** dishwashers can be harsh on blades and handles, leading to corrosion
  and damage. **Handwashing** allows for better control and care.

#### Cutting Boards

Handwash cutting boards with hot, soapy water after each use. For wooden cutting boards, avoid prolonged soaking to prevent warping.

- **Maintenance**: Regularly apply food-safe mineral oil to wooden cutting boards to prevent drying and cracking.
- **Deep Cleaning**: Use a solution of vinegar and water or hydrogen peroxide to disinfect cutting boards.

### Storage

Proper storage helps prevent accidents and maintains the sharpness of your
tools.

- Magnetic strips _*(preferred)*_ on the wall offer an organized and accessible way to store knives.
  Keep knives spaced to avoid blade contact.

- Use a knife block to store knives safely, keeping the blades protected and preventing damage.
  Ensure the knives are fully dry before placing them in the block.
